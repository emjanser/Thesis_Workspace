# Thesis Workspace

Worked with the University of Manchester to develop Multi-Fidelity Neural Network (MFNN) models utilizing Python and PyTorch, focusing on demonstrating the optimal integration of RANS and LES methods with MFNNs. Conducted in-depth research on implementing this technology in industry, aiming to enhance sustainability and improve efficiency in engineering processes. This experience included extensive collaboration with academic and industry partners to ensure the practical application and scalability of the developed models.
